  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      After install cgapp, let's create a new project via interactive console UI (or CUI for short) in current folder:

      $ cgapp create

      Next, open the generated Ansible inventory file (called hosts.ini) and fill in the variables according to your server configuration.

      And you're ready to automatically deploy this project:

      $ cgapp deploy

      That's all you need to know to start! ðŸŽ‰
